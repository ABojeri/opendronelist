# OpenDroneList

OpenDroneList is a public open-source community-driven list of drones and their common properties.

## What is **OpenDroneList** good for?

Thanks to various output formats, including the human-readable HTML table, or computer-readable CSV, JSONs and others, the list can be used for developing your own applications or to use for your data analysis or other projects.

We, [authors](https://dronetag.cz), use opendronelist in many systems and user interfaces requiring the same or similar data â€” for example when you pick pre-defined drone in our mobile app or when using [Dronald](https://dronald.cz), we always query the latest data from the opendronelist to show a list of known drones and their properties.

## Currently available properties

- **Manufacturer & Model Name**
  - The commercial name of the drone
- **Class**
  - UAV Class label designated for the drone (labels such as C0, C1, ...)
- **Weight**
  - The nominal weight of the drone from the manufacturer specifications
  - in grams
- **Max. takeoff weight**
  - The maximum allowed takeoff weight of the drone
  - Usually used to determine the drone's weight category
  - in grams
- **Endurance**
  - The nominal maximum flight time of the drone
  - in minutes
- **Has Camera?**
  - Determines if the drone is equipped with a camera
- **Is Toy?**
