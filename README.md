# opendronelist

Opendronelist is a public open-source community-driven list of drones and their common properties.

## What is **opendronelist** good for?

Thanks to various output formats, including the human-readable HTML table, or computer-readable CSV, JSONs and others, the list can be used for developing your own applications or to use for your data analysis or other projects.

We, [authors](https://dronetag.cz), use opendronelist in many systems and user interfaces requiring the same or similar data â€” for example when you pick pre-defined drone in our mobile app or when using [Dronald](https://dronald.cz), we always query the latest data from the opendronelist to show a list of known drones and their properties.

## Available properties

* Drone model/product name, vendor
* Drone weight
* Drone endurance
  * Used for authoritative processes in U-space
* Year of manufacture (?)
* TODO

## Formats available

The list is avilable in CSV file which is then converted into three JSON files - found [here](https://github.com/dronetag/opendronelist/releases/latest)

## Guaranties & Liability

Since this is a community-driven project, we cannot guarantee the correctness and completeness of the data, even though we try to keep the list always up to date and as correct as possible. Refer to our [license](./LICENSE.MD) when in doubt about liability applied when using our list.
